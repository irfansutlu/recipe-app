          Welcome, I am Irfan. Nice to meet you. I am a web developer. I am a
          junior programmer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love
          structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time
          on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also I like working
          in a team, I'll learn faster and much more.
